Abstract: In this paper, we study the {\em green bin packing} (GBP) problem where $β\ge 0$ and $G \in [0, 1]$ are two given values as part of the input. The energy consumed by a bin is $\max \{0, β(x-G) \}$ where $x$ is the total size of the items packed into the bin. The GBP aims to pack all items into a set of unit-capacity bins so that the number of bins used plus the total energy consumption is minimized. When $β= 0$ or $G = 1$, GBP is reduced to the classic bin packing (BP) problem. In the {\em constrained green bin packing} (CGBP) problem, the objective is to minimize the number of bins used to pack all items while the total energy consumption does not exceed a given upper bound $U$. We present an APTAS and a $\frac 32$-approximation algorithm for both GBP and CGBP, where the ratio $\frac 32$ matches the lower bound of BP. Keywords: Green bin packing; constrained green bin packing; approximation scheme; offline algorithms

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Compressed suffix arrays (CSAs) index large repetitive collections and are key in many text applications. The r-index and its derivatives combine the run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) with suffix array sampling to achieve space proportional to the number of equal-symbol runs in the BWT. While effective for near-identical strings, their size grows quickly as variation increases, since the number of BWT runs is sensitive to edits. Existing approaches typically trade space for query speed, or vice versa, limiting their practicality at large scale.
  We introduce variable-length blocking (VLB), an encoding technique for BWT-based CSAs that adapts the amount of indexing information to local compressibility. The BWT is recursively divided into blocks of at most w runs (a parameter) and organized into a tree. Compressible regions appear near the root and store little auxiliary data, while incompressible regions lie deeper and retain additional information to speed up access. Queries traverse a short root-to-leaf path followed by a small run scan. This strategy balances space and query speed by transferring bits saved in compressible areas to accelerate access in incompressible ones.
  Backward search relies on rank and successor queries over the BWT. We introduce a sampling technique that guarantees correctness only along valid backward-search states, reducing space without affecting query performance.
  We extend VLB to encode the subsampled r-index (sr-index). Experiments show that VLB-based techniques outperform the r-index and sr-index in query time, while retaining space close to that of the sr-index. Compared to the move data structure, VLB offers a more favorable space-time tradeoff.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Omniprediction is a learning problem that requires suboptimality bounds for each of a family of losses $\mathcal{L}$ against a family of comparator predictors $\mathcal{C}$. We initiate the study of omniprediction in a multiclass setting, where the comparator family $\mathcal{C}$ may be infinite. Our main result is an extension of the recent binary omniprediction algorithm of [OKK25] to the multiclass setting, with sample complexity (in statistical settings) or regret horizon (in online settings) $\approx \varepsilon^{-(k+1)}$, for $\varepsilon$-omniprediction in a $k$-class prediction problem. En route to proving this result, we design a framework of potential broader interest for solving Blackwell approachability problems where multiple sets must simultaneously be approached via coupled actions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Janus is a paradigmatic example of reversible programming language. Indeed, Janus programs can be executed backwards as well as forwards. However, its small-step semantics (useful, e.g., for debugging or as a basis for extensions with concurrency primitives) is not reversible, since it loses information while computing forwards. E.g., it does not satisfy the Loop Lemma, stating that any reduction has an inverse, a main property of reversibility in process calculi, where small-step semantics is commonly used. We present here a novel small-step semantics which is actually reversible, while remaining equivalent to the previous one. It involves the non-trivial challenge of defining a semantics based on a "program counter" for a high-level programming language.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Object-oriented programs tend to be written using many common coding idioms, such as those captured by design patterns. While design patterns are useful, implementing them is often tedious and repetitive, requiring boilerplate code that distracts the programmer from more essential details. In this paper, we introduce Mason, a tool that synthesizes object-oriented programs from partial program pieces, and we apply it to automatically insert design patterns into programs. At the core of Mason is a novel technique we call type- and name-guided synthesis, in which an enumerative solver traverses a partial program to generate typing constraints; discharges constraints via program transformations guided by the names of constrained types and members; and backtracks when a constraint is violated or a candidate program fails unit tests. We also introduce two extensions to Mason: a non-local backtracking heuristic that uses execution traces, and a language of patterns that impose syntactic restrictions on missing names. We evaluate Mason on a suite of benchmarks to which Mason must add various well-known design patterns implemented as a library of program pieces. We find that Mason performs well when very few candidate programs satisfy its typing constraints and that our extensions can improve Mason's performance significantly when this is not the case. We believe that Mason takes an important step forward in synthesizing multi-class object-oriented programs using design patterns.

Abstract: With the availability of automation machinery and its superiority, are being slothful and inviting many diseases to invade them. The world still has so many places where people lack basic health facilities. Due to early detection and intervention, CDV can be cured to an extreme extent. It heavily reduces travel and associated costs. A remote ECG monitoring system enables community health workers to support and empower patients through telemedicine. However, there remains some financial and logistical burden. Heart disease cannot be taken lightly. These patients require regular health check-ups and the attention of health personnel in a short period if their health deteriorates suddenly and rapidly. Chronic diseases are extremely variable in their symptoms and evolution of treatment. Some, if not treated early, will end the patient's life. The trend of the INTERNET OF THINGS, IoT, is spreading massively. This paper focuses on the three main: the operator, the doctor, and the server over which the data is being sent.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents SimulatorCoder, an agent powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to generate and optimize deep neural network (DNN) accelerator simulators based on natural language descriptions. By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiayuhuan/SimulatorCoder.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on standard digital logic and Boolean reasoning tasks, yet their reliability under locally redefined semantics remains poorly understood. In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the context of asynchronous concurrent shared-memory systems, a snapshot algorithm allows failure-prone processes to concurrently and atomically write on the entries of a shared array MEM , and also atomically read the whole array. Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in adapting to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. However, practical deployments face challenges when clients have heterogeneous resources and thus adopt different LoRA ranks, leading to substantial initialization and aggregation noise that undermines performance. To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/TNI-playground/Fed-PLoRA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AllReduce is a fundamental collective operation in distributed computing and a key performance bottleneck for large-scale training and inference. Its completion time is determined by the number of communication steps, which dominates latency-sensitive workloads, and the communication distance affecting both latency- and bandwidth-bound regimes. Direct-connect topologies, such as torus networks used in Google's TPUv4, are particularly prone to large communication distances due to limited bisection bandwidth. Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion. In contrast, recent approaches such as Swing reduce communication distance and congestion, but are inherently required to perform $\log_2 n$ steps to complete AllReduce, sacrificing latency-optimality.
  In this paper, we present Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that completes within $\log_3 n$ steps, while reducing congestion compared to Bruck's algorithm by a factor of three and preserving bandwidth-optimality. Trivance exploits both transmission ports of a bidirectional ring within each step to triple the communication distance along both directions simultaneously. Furthermore, by performing joint reductions, Trivance improves both the number of steps and network congestion. We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB. Throughout the evaluation, Trivance remains the best-performing latency-optimal algorithm.

Abstract: Processing sensory data close to the data source, often involving Edge devices, promises low latency for pervasive applications, like smart cities. This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge. Participants can revisit the demo contents as video summary and introductory poster, or build a custom agent by extending the artifact repository.

Abstract: Optimizing resource utilization in high-performance computing (HPC) clusters is essential for maximizing both system efficiency and user satisfaction. However, traditional rigid job scheduling often results in underutilized resources and increased job waiting times.
  This work evaluates the benefits of resource elasticity, where the job scheduler dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of malleable jobs at runtime. Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.
  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.
  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies. These findings confirm the potential of malleability to address inefficiencies in current HPC practices and demonstrate that even limited adoption can provide substantial advantages, encouraging its integration into HPC resource management.

Abstract: We study the self-stabilizing leader election problem in anonymous $n$-nodes networks. Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $Ω(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $Ω(\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs.
  In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = Θ(\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged).

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is essential for managing the massive data volumes produced by large-scale HPC simulations. While state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ and ZFP provide strong numerical error guarantees, they often fail to preserve topological structures (example, minima, maxima, and saddle points) that are critical for scientific analysis. Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios.

Abstract: Driven by scientific and industry ambition, HPC and AI applications such as operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) require processing and storing ever-increasing data volumes as fast as possible. Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads.
  This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.
  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O.
