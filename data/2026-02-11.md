Abstract: Processing large-scale graph datasets is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Processor-centric CPU and GPU architectures, commonly used for graph applications, often face bottlenecks caused by extensive data movement between the processor and memory units due to low data reuse. As a result, these applications are often memory-bound, limiting both performance and energy efficiency due to excessive data transfers. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) offers a promising approach to mitigate data movement bottlenecks by integrating computation directly within or near memory. Although several previous studies have introduced custom PIM proposals for graph processing, they do not leverage real-world PIM systems.
  This work aims to explore the capabilities and characteristics of common graph algorithms on a real-world PIM system to accelerate data-intensive graph workloads. To this end, we (1) implement representative graph algorithms on UPMEM's general-purpose PIM architecture; (2) characterize their performance and identify key bottlenecks; (3) compare results against CPU and GPU baselines; and (4) derive insights to guide future PIM hardware design.
  Our study underscores the importance of selecting optimal data partitioning strategies across PIM cores to maximize performance. Additionally, we identify critical hardware limitations in current PIM architectures and emphasize the need for future enhancements across computation, memory, and communication subsystems. Key opportunities for improvement include increasing instruction-level parallelism, developing improved DMA engines with non-blocking capabilities, and enabling direct interconnection networks among PIM cores to reduce data transfer overheads.

Abstract: Major challenges in LLMs inference remain frequent memory bandwidth bottlenecks, computational redundancy, and inefficiencies in long-sequence processing. To address these issues, we propose LLM-CoOpt, a comprehensive algorithmhardware co-design framework aimed at improving both throughput and latency in LLM inference. LLM-CoOpt integrates three key strategies: (1) Key-Value Cache Optimization, termed Opt-KV, which improves memory access efficiency by optimizing both KV cache write and read paths, and introduces FP8 quantization to reduce memory footprint while maintaining accuracy; (2) Grouped-Query Attention for Computational Efficiency, termed Opt-GQA, which reduces the overall computational complexity by restructuring multi-head self-attention into grouped-query attention with shared key-value projections, enabling higher throughput and lower resource consumption; (3) Paged Attention for Long- Sequence Processing, termed Opt-Pa, which adopts a two-step strategy to first segment long sequences into manageable chunks and then apply lazy memory mapping and computation, significantly reducing memory pressure and improving performance on long-context inputs.Experiments on the LLaMa-13BGPTQ model demonstrate that LLM-CoOpt increases inference throughput by up to 13.43%, reduces latency by up to 16.79%, and maintains model accuracy. These results confirm that LLM-CoOpt provides a practical, high-performance optimization path for real-world inference of large-scale language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When is coordination intrinsically required by a distributed specification, rather than imposed by a particular protocol or implementation strategy? We give a general answer using minimal assumptions. In an asynchronous message-passing model, we show that a specification admits a coordination-free implementation if and only if it is monotone with respect to history extension under an appropriate order on observable outcomes.
  This Coordination Criterion is stated directly over Lamport histories -- partially ordered executions under happens-before -- and specification-defined observable outcomes, without assuming any particular programming language, object implementation, or protocol structure. It yields a sharp boundary between specifications that can be implemented without coordination and those for which coordination is unavoidable. The criterion provides a uniform explanation for a range of classical results, including CAP-style impossibility, CALM-style coordination-freedom, agreement and snapshot tasks, transactional isolation levels, and invariant confluence -- all instances of the same underlying semantic phenomenon.

Abstract: ARM SVE and RISC-V RVV are emerging vector architectures in high-end processors that support vectorization of flexible vector length. In this work, we leverage an important workload for quantum computing, quantum state-vector simulations, to understand whether high-performance portability can be achieved in a vector-length agnostic (VLA) design. We propose a VLA design and optimization techniques critical for achieving high performance, including VLEN-adaptive memory layout adjustment, load buffering, fine-grained loop control, and gate fusion-based arithmetic intensity adaptation. We provide an implementation in Google's Qsim and evaluate five quantum circuits of up to 36 qubits on three ARM processors, including NVIDIA Grace, AWS Graviton3, and Fujitsu A64FX. By defining new metrics and PMU events to quantify vectorization activities, we draw generic insights for future VLA designs. Our single-source implementation of VLA quantum simulations achieves up to 4.5x speedup on A64FX, 2.5x speedup on Grace, and 1.5x speedup on Graviton.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale MoE models presents challenges in memory capacity and bandwidth for expert activation. While Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) has emerged as a potential architecture to decouple compute and memory resources, its performance boundaries compared to standard large-scale Expert Parallelism (EP) remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of AFD by extending the roofline model to the communication level, correlating interconnect bandwidth, arithmetic intensity, and Hardware FLOPS Utilization (HFU). Our analysis reveals a dead zone on standard clusters: increasing FFN instance count fails to improve HFU as computational workload is capped by scale-out bandwidth, causing operator active time to shrink relative to the fixed latency budget. We further show that AFD's discrete node-level scaling incurs higher imbalance penalties than EP's continuous batch adjustment. Nevertheless, these limitations diminish under specific conditions: Superpod-class hardware with abundant interconnect bandwidth and models with coarse-grained experts and lower sparsity are more likely to benefit from AFD. These findings position AFD as a promising approach for specific hardware-model combinations rather than a universal solution.

Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: We study approximation algorithms for Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Max-CSPs) under differential privacy (DP) where the constraints are considered sensitive data. Information-theoretically, we aim to classify the best approximation ratios possible for a given privacy budget $\varepsilon$. In the high-privacy regime ($\varepsilon \ll 1$), we show that any $\varepsilon$-DP algorithm cannot beat a random assignment by more than $O(\varepsilon)$ in the approximation ratio. We devise a polynomial-time algorithm which matches this barrier under the assumptions that the instances are bounded-degree and triangle-free. Finally, we show that one or both of these assumptions can be removed for specific CSPs--such as Max-Cut or Max $k$-XOR--albeit at the cost of computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the maintenance of a $(Δ+C)$-edge-coloring ($C\ge 1$) in a fully dynamic graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ$. We focus on minimizing \emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates.
  We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \emph{fans} and \emph{alternating bicolored paths}.
  We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \emph{tight} recourse of $O\big( \frac{\log n}{\log \frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\big)$ for all $C \ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times.
  A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree.
  Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].

Abstract: Given a set of strings over a specified alphabet, identifying a median or consensus string that minimizes the total distance to all input strings is a fundamental data aggregation problem. When the Hamming distance is considered as the underlying metric, this problem has extensive applications, ranging from bioinformatics to pattern recognition. However, modern applications often require the generation of multiple (near-)optimal yet diverse median strings to enhance flexibility and robustness in decision-making.
  In this study, we address this need by focusing on two prominent diversity measures: sum dispersion and min dispersion. We first introduce an exact algorithm for the diameter variant of the problem, which identifies pairs of near-optimal medians that are maximally diverse. Subsequently, we propose a $(1-ε)$-approximation algorithm (for any $ε>0$) for sum dispersion, as well as a bi-criteria approximation algorithm for the more challenging min dispersion case, allowing the generation of multiple (more than two) diverse near-optimal Hamming medians. Our approach primarily leverages structural insights into the Hamming median space and also draws on techniques from error-correcting code construction to establish these results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As one of the most fundamental problems in graph processing, the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem plays a critical role in numerous application scenarios. However, existing GPU-based solutions remain inefficient, as they typically rely on a single, fixed queue design that incurs severe synchronization overhead, high memory latency, and poor adaptivity to diverse inputs. To address these inefficiencies, we propose MultiLevelMultiQueue (MLMQ), a novel data structure that distributes multiple queues across the GPU's multi-level parallelism and memory hierarchy. To realize MLMQ, we introduce a cache-like collaboration mechanism for efficient inter-queue coordination, and develop a modular queue design based on unified Read and Write primitives. Within this framework, we expand the optimization space by designing a set of GPU-friendly queues, composing them across multiple levels, and further providing an input-adaptive MLMQ configuration scheme. Our MLMQ design achieves average speedups of 1.87x to 17.13x over state-of-the-art implementations. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Leo9660/MLMQ.git.

Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.

Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.
