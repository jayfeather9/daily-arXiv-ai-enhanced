Finding a maximum-size $(k, \\ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library."}

The sensitivity of an algorithm $A$ on a graph $G$ is defined as the maximum Wasserstein distance between the output distributions of $A$ on $G$ and on $G - e$, where $G - e$ is the graph obtained by deleting an edge $e$ from $G$. The maximum is taken over all edges $e$, and the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance is the Hamming distance.\n  We first show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $Δ^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, where $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm is based on sampling from the Gibbs distribution over matchings and runs in time $O_{\\varepsilon, Δ}(m \\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. This result significantly improves the previously known sensitivity bounds.\n  Next, we present significantly faster algorithms for planar and bipartite graphs as a function of $\\varepsilon$ and $Δ$, which run in time $\\mathrm{poly}(n/\\varepsilon)$. This improvement is achieved by designing a more efficient algorithm for sampling matchings from the Gibbs distribution in these graph classes, which improves upon the previous best in terms of running time.\n  Finally, for general graphs with potentially unbounded maximum degree, we show that there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $\\sqrt{n} \\cdot (\\varepsilon^{-1} \\log n)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, improving upon the previous best bound of $O(n^{1/(1+\\varepsilon^2)})$."}

The goal is to decide if a graph that forbids a fixed pattern $H$ as a subgraph contains a triangle, using only \"combinatorial\" methods that notably exclude fast matrix multiplication. Our work aims to classify which patterns admit a subcubic speedup, working towards a dichotomy theorem. On the lower bound side, we show that if $H$ is not $3$-colorable or contains more than one triangle, the complexity of the problem remains unchanged, and no combinatorial speedup is likely possible. On the upper bound side, we develop an embedding approach that results in a strongly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for a rich class of \"embeddable\" patterns. Specifically, for an embeddable pattern of size $k$, our algorithm runs in $\\tilde O(n^{3-\\frac{1}{2^{k-3}}})$ time, where $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ hides poly-logarithmic factors. This algorithm also extends to listing all the triangles within the same time bound. We supplement this main result with two generalizations: 1) A generalization to patterns that are embeddable up to a single obstacle that arises from a triangle in the pattern. This completes our classification for small patterns, yielding a dichotomy theorem for all patterns of size up to eight. 2) An $H$-sensitive algorithm for embeddable patterns, which runs faster when the number of copies of $H$ is significantly smaller than the maximum possible $Ω(n^k)$. Finally, we focus on the special case of odd cycles. We present specialized Triangle Detection algorithms that are very efficient: 1) A combinatorial algorithm for $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs that runs in $\\tilde O(m+n^{1+2/k})$ time for every $k\\geq2$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. 2) A combinatorial $C_5$-sensitive algorithm that runs in $\\tilde O(n^2+n^{4/3}t^{1/3})$ time, where $t$ is the number of $5$-cycles in the graph."}

As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.\n  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs."}

A standard assumption is that clusters induce well-connected subgraphs (i.e. $Ω(1)$-expanders), and form $ε$-sparse cuts. Such a graph defines the clustering uniquely up to $\\approx ε$ misclassification rate, and efficient algorithms for achieving this rate are known. While this vanilla version of graph clustering is well studied, in practice, vertices of the graph are typically equipped with labels that provide additional information on cluster ids of the vertices. For example, each vertex could have a cluster label that is corrupted independently with probability $δ$. Using only one of the two sources of information leads to misclassification rate $\\min\\{ε, δ\\}$, but can they be combined to achieve a rate of $\\approx εδ$?\n  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a sublinear-time algorithm in the number of vertices $n$. Our key algorithmic insight is a new observation on ``spectrally ambiguous'' vertices in a well-clusterable graph.\n  While our sublinear-time classifier achieves the nearly optimal $\\approx \\widetilde O(εδ)$ misclassification rate, the approximate clusters that it outputs do not necessarily induce expanders in the graph $G$. In our second result, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that reweights edges of the original $(k, ε, Ω(1))$-clusterable graph to transform it into a $(k, \\widetilde O(εδ), Ω(1))$-clusterable one (for constant $k$), improving sparsity of cuts nearly optimally and preserving expansion properties of the communities - an algorithm for refining community structure of the input graph."}

Scaling actions triggered by an anomaly detector help achieve target latency at the cost of extra resource consumption. However, performance anomaly detectors make mistakes. This paper studies which characteristics of performance anomaly detection are important to optimize the trade-off between performance and cost. Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary. If detection can be run frequently, a high precision is enough to obtain a good performance-to-cost trade-off, but if the detector is run infrequently, recall becomes the most important."}

We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\\% energy reduction with 2-3\\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline."}

ReqSketch (arXiv:2004.01668) is currently the most space-efficient summary with two key properties: relative error guarantees, offering increasingly higher accuracy towards the distribution's tails, and mergeability, allowing distributed or parallel processing of datasets. Due to these features and its simple algorithm design, ReqSketch has been adopted in practice, via implementation in the Apache DataSketches library. However, the proof of mergeability in ReqSketch is overly complicated, requiring an intricate charging argument and complex variance analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined version of ReqSketch, by developing so-called adaptive compactors. This enables a significantly simplified proof of relative error guarantees in the most general mergeability setting, while retaining the original space bound, update time, and algorithmic simplicity. Moreover, the adaptivity of our sketch, together with the proof technique, yields near-optimal space bounds in specific scenarios - particularly when merging sketches of comparable size."}

Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology.
