Traditional methods like Naive Search, KMP, and Boyer-Moore, while foundational, often fall short in handling the complexities and scale of modern datasets, such as the Reuters corpus and human genomic sequences. This study rigorously investigates text-search algorithms, focusing on optimizing Suffix Trees through methods like Splitting and Ukkonen's Algorithm, analyzed on datasets including the Reuters corpus and human genomes. A novel optimization combining Ukkonen's Algorithm with a new search technique is introduced, showing linear time and space efficiencies, outperforming traditional methods like Naive Search, KMP, and Boyer-Moore. Empirical tests confirm the theoretical advantages, highlighting the optimized Suffix Tree's effectiveness in tasks like pattern recognition in genomic sequences, achieving 100% accuracy. This research not only advances academic knowledge in text-search algorithms but also demonstrates significant practical utility in fields like natural language processing and bioinformatics, due to its superior resource efficiency and reliability."}

The algorithm has been revised for clarity, and feedback is welcome before final submission to a suitable journal", "summary": "The score set of a tournament is defined as the set of its distinct out-degrees. In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection."}

At each step, all neighbors of burning vertices catch fire. A well-studied extension to model fire containment is to allow for fireproofing a number $B$ of non-burning vertices at each step. Interestingly, basic computational questions about this model are computationally hard even on trees. One of the most prominent such examples is Resource Minimization for Fire Containment (RMFC), which asks how small $B$ can be chosen so that a given subset of vertices will never catch fire. Despite recent progress on RMFC on trees, prior work left a significant gap in terms of its approximability. We close this gap by providing an optimal $2$-approximation and an asymptotic PTAS, resolving two open questions in the literature. Both results are obtained in a unified way, by first designing a PTAS for a smooth variant of RMFC, which is obtained through a careful LP-guided enumeration procedure.\n  Moreover, we show that our new techniques, with several additional ingredients, carry over to the non-uniform $k$-center problem (NUkC), by exploiting a link between RMFC on trees and NUkC established by Chakrabarty, Goyal, and Krishnaswamy. This leads to the first approximation algorithm for NUkC that is optimal in terms of the number of additional centers that have to be opened."}

The goal is to design an adaptive query strategy that minimizes the query cost incurred in computing an optimal solution. Solving such problems generally requires that we be able to solve the associated verification problem: given the answers to all queries in advance, find a minimum-cost set of queries that certifies an optimal solution to the combinatorial optimization problem. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for verifying a minimum-weight basis of a matroid, where each weight lies in a given uncertainty area. These areas may be finite sets, real intervals, or unions of open and closed intervals, strictly generalizing previous work by Erlebach and Hoffman which only handled the special case of open intervals. Our algorithm introduces new techniques to address the resulting challenges.\n  Verification problems are of particular importance in the area of explorable uncertainty, as the structural insights and techniques used to solve the verification problem often heavily influence work on the corresponding online problem and its stochastic variant. In our case, we use structural results from the verification problem to give a best-possible algorithm for a promise variant of the corresponding adaptive online problem. Finally, we show that our algorithms can be applied to two learning-augmented variants of the minimum-weight basis problem under explorable uncertainty."}

While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required. This further closes the gap between established real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling analyses."}

Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.\n  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.\n  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable.

In C-PVC, we are given a hypergraph with capacities on its vertices and a partition of the hyperedge set into $ω$ distinct groups. The objective is to select a minimum size subset of vertices that satisfies two main conditions: (1) in each group, the total number of covered hyperedges meets a specified threshold, and (2) the number of hyperedges assigned to any vertex respects its capacity constraint. A covered hyperedge is required to be assigned to a selected vertex that belongs to the hyperedge. This formulation generalizes classical Vertex Cover, Partial Vertex Cover, and Partition Vertex Cover.\n  We investigate two primary variants: soft capacitated (multiple copies of a vertex are allowed) and hard capacitated (each vertex can be chosen at most once). Let $f$ denote the rank of the hypergraph. Our main contributions are: $(i)$ an $(f+1)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted soft-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(ω)}$ time, and $(ii)$ an $(f+ε)$-approximation algorithm for the unweighted hard-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(ω/ε)}$ time.\n  We also study a natural generalization of the edge cover problem, the \\emph{Weighted Partition Edge Cover} (W-PEC) problem, where each edge has an associated weight, and the vertex set is partitioned into groups. For each group, the goal is to cover at least a specified number of vertices using incident edges, while minimizing the total weight of the selected edges.

For that purpose, current cutting-edge methods use hash maps, which boast constant average time complexity and linear memory complexity. However, hash maps often suffer from severe memory limitations on models with immense state spaces. To address this, we propose using prefix trees to store states for large, highly concurrent models (particularly CRNs) for memory savings. We present theoretical analyses and benchmarks demonstrating the favorability of prefix trees over hash maps for very large state spaces.

Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding.
