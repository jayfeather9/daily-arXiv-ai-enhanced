[8] that enables the construction of the Lyndon array using O(1) extra space. Our approach incrementally maintains the lexicographic ranks of the suffixes during the right-to-left BWT construction and then derives the Lyndon array through a simple next-smaller-value procedure. Although not intended for practical use due to its quadratic running time, the method is conceptually simple and works for unbounded alphabets."}

We first define a general notion of $(α,β)$-fairness, where, for parameters $α\\ge 1$ and $β\\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $α/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $β$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(α,β)$-fair solution for $α= 1 + \\varepsilon$ and $β= O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot \\log k / \\varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\\mathrm{diam} \\cdot k \\log k / \\varepsilon)$ term. Here $\\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.\n  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics."}

A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity with measured gas costs demonstrating practical efficiency."}

They are both APX-hard in general graphs. However, this hardness does not carry over to the planar setting, which is not well understood, except for very small values of k. One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks.\n  We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k. By leveraging structural results for minimally k-edge-connected graphs, we further obtain a PTAS for planar k-connectivity augmentation for any constant k. We complement this with an NP-hardness result, showing that our results are essentially optimal."}

To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology."}

Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows."}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline."}

While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\\%."}

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.\n  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention."}
