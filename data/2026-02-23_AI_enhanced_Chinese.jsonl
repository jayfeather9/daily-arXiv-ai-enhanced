However, most existing platforms exhibit rigid architectures with limited configurability, restricting their adaptability to heterogeneous workloads and diverse design objectives.

Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency. Complementing this, we introduce Flex-plorer, a heuristic-guided design-space exploration (DSE) tool that determines cost-effective fixed-point precisions for critical parameters -- such as decay factors, synaptic weights, and membrane potentials -- based on user-defined trade-offs between accuracy and resource usage. Based on the configuration selected through the Flex-plorer process, RTL code is configured to match the specified design. Comprehensive evaluations across MNIST, SHD, and DVS benchmarks demonstrate that the Flexi-NeurA and Flex-plorer co-framework achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency.

Practical tools for parser generation typically apply ad-hoc approaches for resolving such ambiguities, which might result in a parser's behavior that contradicts the intents of the language designer. In this work, we present a user-friendly approach to soundly repair grammars with ambiguities, which is inspired by the programming by example line of research in automated program synthesis. At the heart of our approach is the interpretation of both the initial CFG and additional examples that define the desired restrictions in precedence and associativity, as tree automata (TAs). The technical novelties of our approach are (1) a new TA learning algorithm that constructs an automaton based on the original grammar and examples that encode the user's preferred ways of resolving ambiguities all in a single TA, and (2) an efficient algorithm for TA intersection that utilises reachability analysis and optimizations that significantly reduce the size of the resulting automaton, which results in idiomatic CFGs amenable to parser generators.

In this work, we design algorithms with improved guarantees for $k$-means and $k$-center clustering problems in the weak-strong oracle model. The $k$-means++ algorithm is routinely used to solve $k$-means in settings where complete distance information is available. One of the main contributions of this work is to show that $k$-means++ algorithm can be adapted to work in the weak-strong oracle model using only a small number of strong-oracle queries, which is the critical resource in this model.

In abstract GSOS, bisimilarity is always a congruence, and it coincides with denotational equivalence. This saves the language designer from intricate, ad-hoc reasoning to establish these properties. The bialgebraic perspective on operational semantics in the style of abstract GSOS has recently been extended to higher-order languages, preserving compositionality of bisimilarity. However, a categorical understanding of bialgebraic denotational semantics according to Turi and Plotkin's original vision has so far been missing in the higher-order setting. In the present paper, we develop a theory of adequate denotational semantics in higher-order abstract GSOS. The denotational models are parametric in an appropriately chosen semantic domain in the form of a locally final coalgebra for a behaviour bifunctor, whose construction is fully decoupled from the syntax of the language. Our approach captures existing accounts of denotational semantics such as semantic domains built via general step-indexing, previously introduced on a per-language basis, and is shown to be applicable to a wide range of different higher-order languages, e.g. simply typed and untyped languages, or languages with computational effects such as probabilistic or non-deterministic branching.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution.

Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs.
