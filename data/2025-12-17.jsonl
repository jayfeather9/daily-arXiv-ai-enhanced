However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\\frac{1}{6}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks. Experimental results, based on profiled object detection applications and real-world taxi trace data, show that $\\mathtt{SARound}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying network conditions while maintaining runtime efficiency."}

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications."}

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation."}

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland)."}

These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems."}

The $b$-coloring problem, in which the task is to decide whether a graph admits a $b$-coloring with $k$ colors, is NP-complete in general but polytime solvable on trees. Moreover, it is known that $b$-coloring is in XP but W[$t$]-hard for all $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ when parameterized by tree-width. In fact, only very few parameters, such as the vertex cover number, were known to admit an FPT algorithm for $b$-coloring. In this paper, we consider a more restrictive parameter measuring similarity to trees than tree-width, namely the feedback edge number, and show that $b$-coloring is fixed-parameter tractable under this parameterization. Our algorithm combines standard techniques used in parameterized algorithmics with the problem-specific ideas used in the polytime algorithm for trees. In addition, we present an FPT algorithm for $b$-coloring parameterized by distance to co-cluster, which is a parameter measuring similarity to complete multipartite graphs. Finally, we make several observations based on known results, including that $b$-coloring is W[$1$]-hard when parameterized by tree-depth."}

Architecture-level power models are necessary for early power optimization and design space exploration. However, classical analytical architecture-level power models (e.g., McPAT) suffer from significant inaccuracies. Emerging machine learning (ML)-based power models, despite their superior accuracy in research papers, are not widely adopted in the industry. In this work, we point out three inherent limitations of ML-based power models: unreliability, limited interpretability, and difficulty in usage. This work proposes a new analytical power modeling framework named ReadyPower, which is ready-for-use by being reliable, interpretable, and handy. We observe that the root cause of the low accuracy of classical analytical power models is the discrepancies between the real processor implementation and the processor's analytical model. To bridge the discrepancies, we introduce architecture-level, implementation-level, and technology-level parameters into the widely adopted McPAT analytical model to build ReadyPower. The parameters at three different levels are decided in different ways. In our experiment, averaged across different training scenarios, ReadyPower achieves >20% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and >0.2 higher correlation coefficient R compared with the ML-based baselines, on both BOOM and XiangShan CPU architectures.baselines, on both BOOM and XiangShan CPU architectures."}

Wafer-scale chips (WSCs) provide high computation power and die-to-die (D2D) bandwidth but face a unique trade-off between on-chip memory and compute resources due to limited wafer area. Therefore, tensor parallelism strategies for wafer should leverage communication advantages while maintaining memory efficiency to maximize WSC performance. However, existing approaches fail to address these challenges.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the tensor stream partition paradigm (TSPP), which reveals an opportunity to leverage WSCs' abundant communication bandwidth to alleviate stringent on-chip memory constraints. However, the 2D mesh topology of WSCs lacks long-distance and flexible interconnects, leading to three challenges: 1) severe tail latency, 2) prohibitive D2D traffic contention, and 3) intractable search time for optimal design.\n  We present TEMP, a framework for LLM training on WSCs that leverages topology-aware tensor-stream partition, traffic-conscious mapping, and dual-level wafer solving to overcome hardware constraints and parallelism challenges. These integrated approaches optimize memory efficiency and throughput, unlocking TSPP's full potential on WSCs.

This problem is closely related to the classic maximum weight matching problem. In this paper, we propose a $10/17$-approximation algorithm, improving the best-known $7/12$-approximation algorithm (ESA 2015). Our result is obtained by making a trade-off among three algorithms. The first is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/2$, the second is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/3$, and the last is based on an approximation algorithm for star packing. Our first algorithm is the same as the previous $7/12$-approximation algorithm, but we propose a new analysis method -- a charging method -- for this problem, which is not only essential to analyze our second algorithm but also may be extended to analyze algorithms for some related problems."}

Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency.\n  This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria.\n  We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU.
