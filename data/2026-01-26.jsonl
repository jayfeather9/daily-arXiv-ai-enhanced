A trie is a natural generalization of a string, which can be seen as a single-path tree. There is a linear-time offline algorithm to compute maximal palindromes and distinct palindromes in a given (static) trie whose edge-labels are drawn from a linearly-sortable alphabet [Mieno et al., ISAAC 2022]. In this paper, we tackle problems of palindrome enumeration on dynamic tries which support leaf additions and leaf deletions. We propose the first sub-quadratic algorithms to enumerate palindromes in a dynamic trie. For maximal palindromes, we propose an algorithm that runs in $O(N \\min(\\log h, σ))$ time and uses $O(N)$ space, where $N$ is the maximum number of edges in the trie, $σ$ is the size of the alphabet, and $h$ is the height of the trie. For distinct palindromes, we develop several online algorithms based on different algorithmic frameworks, including approaches using the EERTREE (a.k.a. palindromic tree) and the suffix tree of a trie. These algorithms support leaf insertions and deletions in the trie and achieve different time and space trade-offs. Furthermore, as a by-product, we present online algorithms to construct the suffix tree and the EERTREE of the input trie, which is of independent interest."}

The communities themselves form a collection of vertex-disjoint sparse cuts in the expected graph, and can be recovered, often exactly, from a sample as long as a separation condition on the intra- and inter-community edge probabilities is satisfied.\n  In this paper, we ask whether the presence of a large number of overlapping sparsest cuts in the expected graph still allows recovery. For example, the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph admits $d$ distinct (balanced) sparsest cuts, one for every coordinate. Can these cuts be identified given a random sample of the edges of the hypercube where each edge is present independently with some probability $p\\in (0, 1)$? We show that this is the case, in a very strong sense: the sparsest balanced cut in a sample of the hypercube at rate $p=C\\log d/d$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$ is $1/\\text{poly}(d)$-close to a coordinate cut with high probability. This is asymptotically optimal and allows approximate recovery of all $d$ cuts simultaneously. Furthermore, for an appropriate sample of hypercube-like graphs recovery can be made exact. The proof is essentially a strong hypercube cut sparsification bound that combines a theorem of Friedgut, Kalai and Naor on boolean functions whose Fourier transform concentrates on the first level of the Fourier spectrum with Karger's cut counting argument."}

A notable special case is Partial $k$-Dominating Set, where one chooses $k$ vertices in a graph to maximize the number of dominated vertices.\n  Extensive research has established strong hardness results for various aspects of Maximum $k$-Coverage, such as tight inapproximability results, $W[2]$-hardness, and a conditionally tight worst-case running time of $n^{k\\pm o(1)}$. In this paper we ask: (1) Can this time bound be improved for small $t$, at least for Partial $k$-Dominating Set, ideally to time~$t^{k\\pm O(1)}$? (2) More ambitiously, can we even determine the best-possible running time of Maximum $k$-Coverage with respect to the perhaps most natural parameters: the universe size $u$, the maximum set size $s$, and the maximum frequency $f$?\n  We successfully resolve both questions. (1) We give an algorithm that solves Partial $k$-Dominating Set in time $O(nt + t^{\\frac{2ω}{3} k+O(1)})$ if $ω\\ge 2.25$ and time $O(nt+ t^{\\frac{3}{2} k+O(1)})$ if $ω\\le 2.25$, where $ω\\le 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. From this we derive a time bound that is conditionally optimal, regardless of $ω$, based on the well-established $k$-clique and 3-uniform hyperclique hypotheses from fine-grained complexity. We also obtain matching upper and lower bounds for sparse graphs. To address (2) we design an algorithm for Maximum $k$-Coverage running in time\n  $$\n  \\min \\left\\{ (f\\cdot \\min\\{\\sqrt[3]{u}, \\sqrt{s}\\})^k + \\min\\{n,f\\cdot \\min\\{\\sqrt{u}, s\\}\\}^{kω/3}, n^k\\right\\}\n  \\cdot g(k)n^{\\pm O(1)}, $$ and, surprisingly, further show that this complicated time bound is also conditionally optimal."}

Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches."}

Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance \"glass jaws\". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes."}

Main result is an algorithm that terminates with valid vector agreement, hence operates with safety, liveness, and tolerance to one crash. Reconciling with the FLP impossibility result, we identified: i) existence of two types of agreements: data-independent and data-dependent; and ii) dependence of FLP theorem correctness on three implicit assumptions. Consensus impossibility with data-dependent agreement is contingent on two of them. The theorem-stated impossibility with every agreement type hinges entirely on the third. We provide experimental results showing that the third assumption has no evidence in support."}

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators."}

We present GOXN (Green Observability eXperiment eNginE), an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes-based microservices that quantifies compute, network, and storage energy at the service level. Using GOXN, we evaluated the OpenTelemetry Demo under varying configurations (monitoring, tracing, service mesh) and steady synthetic load, collecting metrics from Kepler and cAdvisor. Our additive energy model derives service-level energy from container-level data. Results show that excluding network and storage can underestimate auxiliary-service energy by up to 63%, and that high tracing loads shift energy dominance toward network and storage."}

Mustafa Rafique", "Franck Cappello", "Bogdan Nicolae"], "title": "DataStates-LLM: Scalable Checkpointing for Transformer Models Using Composable State Providers", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training."}
