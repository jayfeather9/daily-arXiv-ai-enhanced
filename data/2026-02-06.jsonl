An important challenge in the field is scaling cellular resolution models to real-scale tumor simulations, which is critical for the development of digital twin models of diseases and requires the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) since every time step involves trillions of operations. We hereby present a scalable HPC solution for the molecular diffusion modeling using an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method (FVM) frameworks. The paper systematically evaluates a novel scalable Biological Finite Volume Method (BioFVM) library and presents an extensive performance analysis of the available solutions.

The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives. This document presents the summit's findings, beginning with an overview of the current computing ecosystem and the rationale for workflow-centric approaches, followed by a discussion of identified challenges and recommended action lines for advancing scientific discovery through workflows."}

Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments.\n  We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining."}

Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises."}

This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \\emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \\emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?\n  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \\emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \\log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \\log f)$."}

Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced.

While emerging technologies, such as emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM), offer a promising solution to energy efficient computing, their end-to-end footprint is not well understood.

This work conducts a detailed study of one example eNVM device: hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). We present COFFEE, the first carbon modeling framework for HZO-based FeFET eNVMs across life cycle, from hardware manufacturing (embodied carbon) to use (operational carbon). COFFEE builds on data gathered from a real semiconductor fab and device fabrication recipes to estimate embodied carbon, and architecture level eNVM design space exploration tools to quantify use-phase performance and energy. Our evaluation shows that, at 2 MB capacity, the embodied carbon per unit area overhead of HZO-FeFETs can be up to 11% higher than the CMOS baseline, while the embodied carbon per MB remains consistently about 4.3x lower than SRAM across different memory capacity. A further case study applies COFFEE to an edge ML accelerator, showing that replacing the SRAM-based weight buffer with HZO-based FeFET eNVMs reduces embodied carbon by 42.3% and operational carbon by up to 70%."}

Our focus is on minimizing total delivery time by coordinating agents that differ in speed and movement range across a graph. This problem formulation aligns with the recently proposed Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT), introduced by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022].\n  We first resolve an open question posed by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022] by showing that even when the delivery network is a path graph, DDT admits no polynomial-time approximation within any polynomially encodable factor $a(n)$, unless P=NP. Additionally, we identify the intersection graph of the agents, where nodes represent agents and edges indicate an overlap of the movement areas of two agents, as an important structural concept. For path graphs, we show that DDT becomes tractable when parameterized by the treewidth $w$ of the intersection graph, and we present an exact FPT algorithm with running time $f(w)\\cdot\\text{poly}(n,k)$, for some computable function $f$. For general graphs, we give an FPT algorithm with running time $f(Δ,w)\\cdot\\text{poly}(n,k)$, where $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the intersection graph.

Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings."}

Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations."}

We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognized, one may specify a hash function more tailored to some assumed key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case this assumption does not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance, as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys \\emph{and} faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API.

Motivated by these lower bounds, we then discuss a semi-online extension in which the algorithm may delay assignment for up to $τ$ time steps and solve each batch optimally via a min-cost flow computation. We present this batching framework as a remediation strategy and delineate the parameters that govern its performance, while leaving sharp competitive guarantees for this semi-online variant as an open direction."}

DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\\sf{col}(v) \\in C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_t\\}, t\\leq n$. A set $R = \\{r_1, \\dots, r_k\\}$ of $k \\leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\\mathsf{col}(r_i) \\in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.\n  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION."}
