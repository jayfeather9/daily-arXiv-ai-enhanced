Their work is considered a milestone in the development of type-and-effect systems, and has inspired numerous subsequent works in the area of static analysis. However, unlike the later research it spawned, the original algorithm considered a language with higher-rank polymorphism, a feature which is challenging to implement correctly. In this note, we identify subtle bugs related to variable binding in their approach to this feature. We revisit their type system and reconstruction algorithm, and describe the discovered issues."}

However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization."}

This paper presents an industry case study of an open-source, multi-tenant platform that enables small businesses to deploy customised LLM-based support chatbots via a no-code workflow. The platform is built on distributed, lightweight k3s clusters spanning heterogeneous, low-cost machines and interconnected through an encrypted overlay network, enabling cost-efficient resource pooling while enforcing container-based isolation and per-tenant data access controls. In addition, the platform integrates practical, platform-level defences against prompt injection attacks in RAG-based chatbots, translating insights from recent prompt injection research into deployable security mechanisms without requiring model retraining or enterprise-scale infrastructure. We evaluate the proposed platform through a real-world e-commerce deployment, demonstrating that secure and efficient LLM-based chatbot services can be achieved under realistic cost, operational, and security constraints faced by small businesses."}

In particular, for $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (i.e. the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\\frac k ε\\log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+ε)c$, for any $ε>0$. This leads to better instance-specific approximations for certain instances of the buy-at-bulk and dial-a-ride problems, whose current best approximation algorithms go through HST embeddings.\n  In order to facilitate our results, we largely focus on the concept of compositions of nested embeddings introduced by [Chawla and Sheridan 2024]. A nested embedding is a composition of two embeddings of a metric space $(X,d)$ -- a low distortion embedding of a subset $S$ of nodes, and a higher distortion embedding of the entire metric. The composition is a single embedding that preserves the low distortion over $S$ and does not increase distortion over the remaining points by much. In this paper, we expand this concept from the setting of deterministic embeddings to the setting of probabilistic embeddings. We show how to find good nested compositions of embeddings into HSTs, and combine this with an approximation algorithm of [Munagala et al. 2023] to obtain our results."}

Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing.

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores."}

PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \\textit{bounded} and \\textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors."}

SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale."}

Its reverse-complement variant, the Shortest Common Superstring problem with Reverse Complements (SCS-RC), naturally arises in bioinformatics applications, where for each input string, either the string itself or its reverse complement must appear as a substring of the superstring. The well-known MGREEDY algorithm for the standard SCS constructs a superstring by first computing an optimal cycle cover on the overlap graph and then concatenating the strings corresponding to the cycles, while its refined variant, TGREEDY, further improves the approximation ratio. Although the original 4- and 3-approximation bounds of these algorithms have been successively improved for the standard SCS, no such progress has been made for the reverse-complement setting. A previous study extended MGREEDY to SCS-RC with a 4-approximation guarantee and briefly suggested that extending TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting could achieve a 3-approximation. In this work, we strengthen these results by proving that the extensions of MGREEDY and TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting achieve 3.75- and 2.875-approximation ratios, respectively. Our analysis extends the classical proofs for the standard SCS to handle the bidirectional overlaps introduced by reverse complements. These results provide the first formal improvement of approximation guarantees for SCS-RC, with the 2.875-approximate algorithm currently representing the best known bound for this problem."}

The tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of $G$. As shown recently by Lima et al. [ESA~2024], a large family of optimization problems asking for a maximum-weight induced subgraph of bounded treewidth, satisfying a given \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property, can be solved in polynomial time in graphs whose tree-independence number is bounded by some constant~$k$.\n  However, the complexity of the algorithm of Lima et al. grows rapidly with $k$, making it useless if the tree-independence number is superconstant. In this paper we present a refined version of the algorithm. We show that the same family of problems can be solved in time~$n^{\\mathcal{O}(k)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the instance, $k$ is the tree-independence number, and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on the treewidth bound of the solution and the considered \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property.\n  This running time is quasipolynomial for classes of graphs with polylogarithmic tree-independence number; several such classes were recently discovered. Furthermore, the running time is subexponential for many natural classes of geometric intersection graphs -- namely, ones that admit balanced clique-based separators of sublinear size."}

We further complement our results with a conditional lower bound: assuming subquadratic preprocessing time, achieving truly sublinear update time for the case k = Ω(log n) would contradict the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Finally, we develop sublinear algorithms for two special cases: - If the pattern contains w non-wildcard symbols, we give an algorithm with preprocessing time O(nw) and update time O(w + log n), which is truly sublinear whenever wis truly sublinear. - Using FFT technique combined with block decomposition, we design a deterministic truly sublinear algorithm with preprocessing time O(n^1.8) and update time O(n^0.8 log n) for the case that there are at most two non-wildcards."}
