When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts."}

This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces.\n  We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries.

StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement.\n  By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness.\n  To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space.\n  We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving."}

Ensuring these properties within a compositional framework is even more challenging. In this paper, we propose partial-state lenses, which allow source and view states to be partially specified to precisely represent the user's update intentions. These intentions are partially ordered, providing clear semantics for merging intentions of updates coming from multiple views and a refined notion of update preservation compatible with this merging. We formalize partial-state lenses, together with partial-specifiedness-aware well-behavedness that supports compositional reasoning and ensures update preservation.

To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE).

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.\n  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.\n  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.\n  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital."}

Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter.

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency."}

Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.\n  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.\n  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds\" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.\n  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation.

Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\\%, achieves up to $2.9\\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead."}

From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \\cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020).\n  Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection."}

In this paper, we present the first lock-free augmented balanced search tree. Our algorithmic ideas build upon a recent augmented unbalanced search tree presented by Fatourou and Ruppert [DISC, 2024]. We implement both data structures, solving some memory reclamation challenges in the process, and provide an experimental performance analysis of them. We also present optimized versions of our balanced tree that use delegation to achieve better scalability and performance (by more than 2x in some workloads). Our experiments show that our augmented balanced tree is 2.2 to 30 times faster than the unbalanced augmented tree, and up to several orders of magnitude faster than unaugmented trees on 120 threads."}
